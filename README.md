# QmToolPyV4 – Generated Feature Artifacts (master.zip)

This ZIP contains generated `README.md`, `meta.json`, and `contracts.json` files per feature folder.

Source:
- Generated from the direct GitHub archive: `QmToolPyV4/archive/refs/heads/master.zip`

Important:
- Existing meta.json files were copied as-is.
- Missing meta.json files were generated with minimal required keys only.
- `contracts.json` is derived from:
  - `meta.json` main_class/settings_class
  - keyword-only constructor parameters (DI-by-name)
  - direct imports between feature packages

No assumptions:
- Interface/ABC paths are intentionally `null` because `core/contracts/` is not yet implemented in this repo.
